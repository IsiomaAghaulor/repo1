            <em>Growing up I was often dissatisfied with dresses my mum made for me via local tailors. </em>
             Their finishing was poor and they werenâ€™t able to interpret my ideas the way I pictured them.
              I preferred clothes bought for me by my dad who was located outside Nigeria then. 
              I loved their neat finishing and chic style. 
              Eventually, my mum stopped making clothes for me via local tailors and would only buy me fabric. 
              Since I had fabric, I began to imagine and make research on styles. 
              Years later, I enrolled in a fashion school in order to equip myself with the technical knowledge required to design and construct high quality clothes.
              My own experience as well as my Interaction with other fashion designers also exposed me to the challenges <br>fashion entrepreneurs face in Nigeria such as funding, skill and unavailability of machines and equipment.</strong> </p1>
